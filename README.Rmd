# mobile-app

This repo has scripts to prepare the data for the EUROCONTROL Data mobile app.

# Scripts description

**Main scripts**:

- `copy_to_production`: Main script executing all the other necessary ones to generate the json files needed for the app. It is automated to be run every morning. The set of json files is saved in the network folder below from where  `r `subcontractor` retrieves them and copies them into their database to serve the app:
`//ihx-vdm05/LIVE_var_www_performance$/briefing`

- `generate_json_files_nw/ao/st/ap`: Retrieve the raw data, generate the json files and saves them locally in the repo's data folder.
 
**Support scripts**:

- `helpers`: contains the functions used in other scripts.
- `params`: sets the necessary parameters.
- `get_common_data`: retrieves some datasets used for other scripts to avoid loading them multiple times, a.o. the dimension tables.

**Generation of archive csvs**:

- `generate_archive_data`: Generates source csv files necessary to generate json files for past dates. Only needs to be run if further dates or new stakeholders are needed.
- `ao/ap/nw/st_queries`: Contains SQL queries with the date as a parameter used by the previous script to generate past csv files.
